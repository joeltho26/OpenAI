Abdul Kalam, told a group of Carleton University students last \\nmonth that they must take responsibility for their place in a changing world .  \\n \\n“Science and technology enhance the purpose and quality of human life ,’’ Kalam said during the \\nInaugural Bugh Singh and Kashmir Kaur Dhahan Lecture presented by the Canada -India Centre for \\nExcellen ce in Science, Technology, Trade and Policy.  \\n \\nElected as president of India in 2002, Kalam served in office for five years.  \\n \\nThe 82 year -old lifelong educator and former president of the second most populous country in the \\nworld began his speech with a n ote of caution. Kalam outlined a number of the problems afflicting \\ndeveloping nations today, and posed a question to the audience that helped frame his vision for the \\nworld .  \\n \\n“In this environment of conflict, I’m asking myself, in the presence of such an enlightened audience on \\nCarleton campus:  can we collectively make it possible in every part of the world, to have people living in \\na green environment without pollution, to have prosperity without poverty, and to have peace with no \\nfear of war.”  \\n \\n“That is  the theme of the talk.”  \\n \\nKalam’s knowledge of historical events and his unique insight into the convergence of religious \\nexperience and modern culture was on full display that evening . In the opening minutes of his speech, \\nKalam touched on theology and sp irituality, science and technology, and the legacies of Abraham \\nLincoln, Nelson Mandela , and Mahatma Gandhi.  \\n \\n“In the last 150 years , we have witnessed two world wars, hundreds of battles between hostile socie ties, \\nand the beginnings of 133 democratic nat ions being freed from foreign dominations.” Kalam said.  \\n \\nThree Carleton graduate students studying sustainable -engineering arrived at the event almost a full \\nhour early. As they anxiously awaited the arrival of the former president, their enthusiasm for listening \\nto the iconic Indian was nothing short of infectious. And that enthusiasm only grew as Kala m concluded \\nhis remarks .  \\n \\n “He’s a visionary, and we love to hear him,” said Binita Desai, 27. “He’s so inspiring when he gives us the \\nstories  of how he grew up and how he learns things. That is something that we completely look forward \\nto and we would l ove to have the same morals as he does.”  \\n \\nGurjan Kak said that she’d never seen a leader give such a lecture.  \\n \\n“He’s not a person that a few handful of people know or want to talk to. I saw people who might be his \\nage who were so curious about what he thought. Even people who were my age were asking questions. \\nAnd that’s a beautiful thing.”  \\n For Fuad Ahmed, Kalam is “basically an enigma for youngsters. I think you saw the enthusiasm when he \\nasked the youngsters to stand up at the end more than anyone el se. Because he wants young people to \\ndevelop their thought processes.”  \\n \\n“The way he spoke, the way he talks, there’s just so much humility and humbleness there.”  \\n \\nThey all shared a deep knowledge of Kalam’s work, not only as the former president of the an cient \\nnation, but as an educator and leader of youth. Throughout the evening, their faces betrayed just how \\nenthralled they were with stories of his travels throughout India, inspiring millions of youth in villages \\nand cities alike to work toward a more pr osperous and peaceful society.  \\n \\nAt the end of the night a middle -aged  man stood up and posed a question to th e esteemed educator. \\nKalam was asked what he thought was the largest obstacle to progress in the world today . His answer \\nwas simple.  \\n \\n“The day th e youth say it cannot be done is the day it cannot be done. I am confident.”  \\n \\nHis faith in the power of ideas brought him to one of the highest offices in India, and he came to \\nCarleton to impart that wisdom upon a crowd eager to take up his challenge.
